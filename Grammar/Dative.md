**German Plurals: The Dative Case**  

For most German one-syllable nouns, the -e ending will be needed in their plural form. However, in the dative case, the noun always adds an -en ending (and there may be umlaut changes). For "the hands," in the dative case it is "den Händen" and for "the dogs" it is "den Hunden."  

For most German masculine or neuter nouns, the plural will end in -er with the exception of the dative case: they will end in -ern in the dative case. There may also be umlaut changes. For example, for "the books" it is "den Büchern." An example sentence would be "Der Junge lernt mit den Büchern." (The boy is learning with the books). Or for "the children," this would mean "den Kindern."  

Whereas most neuter or masculine nouns ending in -chen, -lein, -el, or -er, require no change of the noun in the plural, they end in -n in the dative case. There may be umlaut changes. For example, for "the windows" it is "den Fenstern" for the dative plural. An example sentence would be: "Es funktioniert mit den Fenstern." (It works with the windows). For "the mothers," it is "den Müttern" as in: "Ich spreche mit den Müttern." (I talk with the mothers).
